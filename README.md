# Metro Real-Time Disposition Optimization using the Alternative Graph Model

This repository contains the source code of the algorithm described in my master's thesis. For
documentation of the concepts please look at [the thesis](Thesis.pdf). 

For running the project you need an infrastructure model and timetable model. The one used in the
thesis can be retrieved from the [RAS Problem
Repository](https://connect.informs.org/railway-applications/new-item3/problem-repository16). You
need to extract the different sheets of the provided Excel file into individual CSV files for the
parser to work correctly.
